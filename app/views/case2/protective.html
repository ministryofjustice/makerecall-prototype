<span>Work through this checklist before you record your recommendation for this case.</span>

<h2>Have you thought about protective factors and alternatives to recall?</h2>
<li>What protective factors are in place and what has worked in the past?</li>
<li>Would recalling  Charles Edwin have a negative affect any of the protective factors?</li>
<li>Has Charles Edwin been screened into the Offender Personality Disorder (OPD) Pathway and a case formulation completed?</li>
<li>Has there been a consultation with the specialist probation officer and psychologist?</li>
<li>What contingencies are in place on the risk management plan? Can you start any of them now?</li>
<li>Does the contingency plan state what behaviour would meet the threshold for an out of hours recall?</li>
<li>Can the out of hours head of function make a defensible decision when the offender manager is not available?</li>
<li>If you are a probation officer, have you had a reflective discussion with your senior probation officer about your options?</li>
