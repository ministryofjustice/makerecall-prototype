         <li>If Mr Edwin demonstrates a lack of compliance with his licence conditions, options include sending warning letters, behavioural contracts, and increased reporting. OM might also look into introducing stricer curfew times. A revised RMP may be appropriate to certain behaviours/changes in circumstances. If risk is unmanageable then recall needs to be enforced.</li>

         <li>Mr Edwin needs ongoing safety planning is to be ongoing. If there are any concerns then MAPPA is the right forum for discussing these. </li>

         <li>If Mr Edwin connects back with people in his old estate associated with gangs (who have previously been associated with an increase in risk), then OM should consider issuing a warning letter, additional licence conditions, or recall in certain scenarios.</li>

         <li>If Mr Edwin fails to follow licence conditions or neglects to follow intervention requirements, recall to custody should be considered. </li>

         <li>If Mr Edwin does not make progress on undersatnding his drug misuse and impact on other people, his interventions should be reviewed to find the right approach that works for him, with sentence plan amended. If Mr Edwin still does not respond to sentence plan, suggest a warning and then ultimately recall.</li>

         <li>If Mr Edwin is unable to secure stable employment, recommend reviewing interventions and sentence management plan to identify better pathways to emploiyment. </li>

         <li>If Mr Edwin continues to struggle with his financial situation, I recommend interventions focused on a) budget management and b) finding a job.  Citizen Advice Bureau and CGL can help here. </li>
