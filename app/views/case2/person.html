<p>
    Mr Edwin grabbed Mr Smith by the collar and shouted 'give me your phone and your wallet'. Mr Smith loudly told him to 'f**k off'. Mr Edwin hit Mr Smith in the face, breaking his nose and causing him to bleed, and saying 'Give me your phone and wallet or I will hit you again'. Mr Smith gave him his wallet and phone Mr Edwin pushed him into his seat. Mr Edwin ran off the bus at the next stop and ran off. </p>
<p>
He was known to police and so the CCTV imagery helped identify him. Police arrested him 2 days later, on the 22 April 2018. On being tested Mr Edwin had crack cocaine in his system.</p>"
