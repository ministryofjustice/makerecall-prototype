<span>Work through this checklist before you record your recommendation for this case.</span>

<h2>Is the time right?</h2>
<li>How long has Charles Edwin been in the community for?</li>
<li>Is he struggling to adapt to life in the community compared to custody?</li>
<li>Is this his first breach of licence and is it serious enough to recall him?</li>
<li>Is Charles Edwin on a short licence about to move into the Post Sentence Supervision (PSS) period?</li>
<li>Could other measures which support and focus on rehabilitation work in this case?</li>
<li>Is  Charles Edwin approaching his sentence end date (SED)? Would recall at this stage increase risk, if they are released without any support</li>
