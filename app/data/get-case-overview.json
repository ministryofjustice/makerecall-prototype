      "longDescription": "On 1 July 2021 Mr Edwin had been drinking with friends/criminal associates in pubs around and also taking cocaine (as confirmed by drug tests after arrest). The day before he had had an argument with his girlfriend and she kicked him out of their shared house, leaving Mr Edwin to spend the night on the sofa of his friend/associate Herc Carver. \n\n At 5pm Mr Edwin entered the Rawls Arms on James Street along with Mr Carver and their friends/associates Frank Landsman, Michael Wagstaff and Russell Barksdale. Mr Daniels, Mr Moreland and Mr Bell are believed to be associates of Mr Edwin in the Westside Gang based in the Regents Road estate. They proceeded to drink beer and whisky and take cocaine in the toilets.\n\n At 8pm the victim Wallace Stanfield entered the pub with his friend/associate Dennis Cousins. They are believed to be members of the Greenwood Boys gang, rivals to Westside.\n\nAt 9pm Mr Stanfield made a comment to Mr Edwin about his being kicked out of his girlfriend's house the previous night. Mr Edwin smashed his pint glass into Mr Stanfield's face, causing him to bleed badly from severe cuts on his cheek and neck. Mr Cousins pushed Mr Edwin away, and Mr Edwin, Mr Daniels, Mr Moreland and Mr Bell ran out of the pub. The pub staff called 999 and the ambulance and police turned up. Mr Stanfield received emergency treatment in the ambulance which stopped the bleeding but has been left with bad scars.\n\nThe pub staff identified Mr Edwin and the police arrested him on July 3 on the Regents Road estate.",

If there are any concerns then MAPPA is the right forum for discussing these.\nIf Mr Edwin connects back with people in his old estate associated with gangs (who have previously been associated with an increase in risk), then OM should consider issuing a warning letter, additional licence conditions, or recall in certain scenarios.\n\nIf Mr Edwin fails to follow licence conditions or neglects to follow intervention requirements, recall to custody should be considered.\nIf Mr Edwin does not make progress on undersatnding his drug misuse and impact on other people, his interventions should be reviewed to find the right approach that works for him, with sentence plan amended. If Mr Edwin still does not respond to sentence plan, suggest a warning and then ultimately recall.\n\nIf Mr Edwin is unable to secure stable employment, recommend reviewing interventions and sentence management plan to identify better pathways to emploiyment.\n\nIf Mr Edwin continues to struggle with his financial situation, I recommend interventions focused on a) budget management and b) finding a job.
