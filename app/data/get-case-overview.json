If there are any concerns then MAPPA is the right forum for discussing these.\nIf Mr Edwin connects back with people in his old estate associated with gangs (who have previously been associated with an increase in risk), then OM should consider issuing a warning letter, additional licence conditions, or recall in certain scenarios.\n\nIf Mr Edwin fails to follow licence conditions or neglects to follow intervention requirements, recall to custody should be considered.\nIf Mr Edwin does not make progress on undersatnding his drug misuse and impact on other people, his interventions should be reviewed to find the right approach that works for him, with sentence plan amended. If Mr Edwin still does not respond to sentence plan, suggest a warning and then ultimately recall.\n\nIf Mr Edwin is unable to secure stable employment, recommend reviewing interventions and sentence management plan to identify better pathways to emploiyment.\n\nIf Mr Edwin continues to struggle with his financial situation, I recommend interventions focused on a) budget management and b) finding a job.
